# Explainable Accident Anticipation
This is partial implementation code for the paper, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.00273.pdf7"> "Towards explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for early anticipation of traffic accidents"</a> by Muhammad Monjurul Karim, Yu Li, and Ruwen Qin, accepted at Transportation Research Record.</p>

## Dataset
This code currently support CCD dataset for accident anticipation. 
> * For CCD dataset, please refer to the [CarCrashDataset Official](https://github.com/Cogito2012/CarCrashDataset) repo for downloading and deployment.
> * To create human attention map this study collected gaze data for 100 videos taken from CCD test dataset. Video data along with their gaze information of 12 participants can be downloaded from [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17F_wyVg5sQP-Vln93qHS17l-9AjEQsBG?usp=sharing)

## Installation Guide
A complete step-by-step installation guide and the rest of the code will be uploaded soon...
